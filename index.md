## Catalan Covid19 Vaccination Tracker

**Goal**: Observe the effect of vaccination on the overall well-being of the Catalan population. 

**How**: Tracking the expected acceleration on the rate of vaccination and see if it (hopefully) anticorrelates with the number of cases and hospitalizations.

**Since** Day of first vaccination: 2020-12-27

**It is not**: A website to track the virus evolution since the first detected cases. 

**Because**: There are many excellent websites for that. Worldwide tracking [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) and Catalan tracking [BIOCOMSC](https://biocomsc.upc.edu/en/covid-19/catalonia-covid-abs-eng).

***Data***:

- Covid-19 data is taken from the [Covid-19 data repository from the Catalan Department of Health](https://dadescovid.cat/descarregues)

- Population data is taken from the [Statistical Institute of Catalonia](http://www.idescat.cat)
